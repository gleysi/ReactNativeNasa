This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# 🌌 NASA Image Viewer - React Native App

This is a React Native application that fetches and displays images from NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) API.

- 📱 Features
  - 📸 Displays today's featured NASA image with title and date.
  - 🔍 "View" button shows more details and description of the image inline or in a modal.
  - 📆 Scroll view of the last 5 days' images, each with their own "View" button to access additional information.
  - 🎨 Clean UI with styled containers, images, and text.
- 🚀 Tech Stack
  - React Native
  - NASA APOD API
  - fetch or axios for API calls
  - ScrollView for displaying multiple days of content
- 🧠 How It Works
  - On launch, the app fetches today's NASA APOD entry and displays the image, title, and date.
  - A "View" button allows users to toggle or navigate to a detailed view with full description.
  - Below the main image, a horizontally scrollable list shows the last 5 days of APOD entries.
  - Each item in the list also features a "View" button to access extended content for that day.

# 🔑 NASA API Key
To use this app, you will need a <a href="https://api.nasa.gov">NASA API key.</a> You can use the DEMO_KEY for basic usage or register for a free API key for higher rate limits.

# Getting Started

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [Set Up Your Environment](https://reactnative.dev/docs/set-up-your-environment) guide before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start Metro

First, you will need to run **Metro**, the JavaScript build tool for React Native.

To start the Metro dev server, run the following command from the root of your React Native project:

```sh
# Using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Build and run your app

With Metro running, open a new terminal window/pane from the root of your React Native project, and use one of the following commands to build and run your Android or iOS app:

### Android

```sh
# Using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### iOS

For iOS, remember to install CocoaPods dependencies (this only needs to be run on first clone or after updating native deps).

The first time you create a new project, run the Ruby bundler to install CocoaPods itself:

```sh
bundle install
```

Then, and every time you update your native dependencies, run:

```sh
bundle exec pod install
```

For more information, please visit [CocoaPods Getting Started guide](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html).

```sh
# Using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see your new app running in the Android Emulator, iOS Simulator, or your connected device.

This is one way to run your app — you can also build it directly from Android Studio or Xcode.

## Step 3: Modify your app

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's make changes!

Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and make some changes. When you save, your app will automatically update and reflect these changes — this is powered by [Fast Refresh](https://reactnative.dev/docs/fast-refresh).

When you want to forcefully reload, for example to reset the state of your app, you can perform a full reload:

- **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Dev Menu**, accessed via <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (Windows/Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (macOS).
- **iOS**: Press <kbd>R</kbd> in iOS Simulator.

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:
