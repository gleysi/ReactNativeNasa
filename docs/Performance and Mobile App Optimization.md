## Render Optimization

### Situation Challenge: List Optimization

You have a parent component, `HomeScreen`, which contains a large `FlatList` displaying many `ProductItem` components. The `HomeScreen` also has an unrelated `clickCount` state that causes it to re-render frequently.

#### Your challenge:

  <b> 1. How do you apply `React.mem`o to the `ProductItem` component?</b>

  <b> 2. How would you define the `handlePress` function in the parent `HomeScreen` component to ensure that the `ProductItem` components <b>DO NOT re-render</b> when the unrelated `clickCount` state changes?</b>

<b>1. ProductItem.js: Using React.memo (Component Memoization)</b>

```tsx
// ProductItem.js

import React from 'react';
import { Text } from 'react-native';

const ProductItem = ({ product, onSelect }) => {
    // This console log helps prove the component is being rendered.
    console.log(`Rendering ProductItem for: ${product.name}`); 
    
    // The component just uses the props passed to it.
    return (
        <Text onPress={() => onSelect(product.id)}>
            {product.name}
        </Text>
    );
};

// 1. Solution: Export the component wrapped in React.memo
// This tells React: "Only re-render if the 'product' or 'onSelect' props change."
export default React.memo(ProductItem);
```

<b> 2. HomeScreen.js: Using useCallback (Function Memoization)</b>

```tsx
// HomeScreen.js
import React, { useState, useCallback } from 'react';
import { View, Text, FlatList } from 'react-native';
// import ProductItem from './ProductItem'; // Assumed import
// const PRODUCT_DATA = [...]; // Assumed data list

const HomeScreen = () => {
    const [clickCount, setClickCount] = useState(0); 
    
    // 2. Solution: Use useCallback to memoize the function passed to the child items.
    // The handleItemSelect function DOES NOT need to change when clickCount changes,
    // so its identity remains stable, preventing unnecessary ProductItem re-renders.
    const handleItemSelect = useCallback((itemId) => {
        console.log(`Item selected with ID: ${itemId}`);
        // This is a separate action from the clickCount
    }, []); // Empty dependency array: ensures a stable function identity

    // Unrelated counter update logic (your original intent)
    const handleCounterClick = () => {
        setClickCount(c => c + 1);
    };

    return (
        <View style={{ flex: 1 }}>
            {/* This component re-renders the HomeScreen, but NOT the FlatList items */}
            <Text onPress={handleCounterClick} style={{ padding: 20 }}>
                Unrelated Clicks: {clickCount} (Triggers Parent Render)
            </Text>
            
            <FlatList
                data={PRODUCT_DATA} // Use your actual data list here
                keyExtractor={item => item.id.toString()}
                renderItem={({ item }) => (
                    // Pass the memoized function to the memoized child
                    <ProductItem 
                        product={item} 
                        onSelect={handleItemSelect} 
                    />
                )}
            />
        </View>
    );
}
```

"I used `React.memo` on `ProductItem` to stop unnecessary re-renders. This works because React will only check if its props have changed via a shallow comparison. Since the `product` object and the function `onSelect` are the props, I must ensure they have a <b>stable identity</b>."

"To guarantee this stable identity for the `onSelect` function, I define it in the parent using `useCallback`. Because its dependency array is empty (`[]`), the function reference remains the same object across every re-render of `HomeScreen` (even when `clickCount` changes), satisfying `React.memo` and preventing the entire list from re-rendering."


## Debugging and Error Handling

### Opening the Dev Menu
React Native provides an in-app developer menu providing access to debugging features. You can access the Dev Menu by shaking your device or via keyboard shortcuts:

- iOS Simulator: `Ctrl` + `Cmd ‚åò` + `Z` (or Device > Shake)
- Android emulators: `Cmd ‚åò` + `M` (macOS) or `Ctrl` + `M` (Windows and Linux)

### Opening DevTools

<a href="https://reactnative.dev/docs/react-native-devtools">React Native DevTools</a> is our built-in debugger for React Native. It allows you to inspect and understand how your JavaScript code is running, similar to a web browser.

To open DevTools, either:

- Select "Open DevTools" in the Dev Menu.
- Press `j` from the CLI (`npx react-native start`).

On first launch, DevTools will open to a welcome panel, along with an open console drawer where you can view logs and interact with the JavaScript runtime. From the top of the window, you can navigate to other panels, including the integrated React Components Inspector and Profiler.

### LogBox
LogBox is an in-app tool that displays when warnings or errors are logged by your app.

<img src="https://github.com/gleysi/ReactNativeNasa/blob/main/src/assets/logbox.jpg?raw=true"/>

### Performance Monitor
On Android and iOS, an in-app performance overlay can be toggled during development by selecting "Perf Monitor" in the Dev Menu. Learn more about this feature <a href="https://reactnative.dev/docs/performance">here</a>.

## Asynchronous Data Handling and User Experience

A critical difference between web and mobile development is the reliance on data fetching and the need for a **polished experience during load times**.


### 1. Fetch vs. Axios (The API Battle)

In React Native, you have two primary options for making API calls. While they achieve the same result, an interviewer might ask about the pros and cons of each.

| Feature | Built-in `fetch` | Third-party `Axios` |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Source** | Built into the browser/runtime (available globally). | **External library** (requires `npm install axios`). |
| **Interface** | Uses **Promises directly**, requiring `.then().then()`. | Uses Promises, but with a simpler, **cleaner syntax**. |
| **Auto JSON** | Does **not auto-parse JSON**. Requires a manual `.then(res => res.json())`. | **Automatically parses JSON** response data. |
| **Error Handling** | **Only rejects the Promise on network failure** (e.g., connection lost). HTTP errors (4xx, 5xx) are **not** rejections. | **Rejects the Promise automatically** on both network failure **AND HTTP error status** (4xx, 5xx). (This is a huge advantage.) |
| **Interceptors** | Does **not** natively support them. | **Supports interceptors** for request/response handling (e.g., attaching auth tokens, logging). (Major advantage for complex apps.) |

**Interview Verdict**: For small apps, `fetch` is fine. For **intermediate and enterprise-level apps, `Axios` is strongly preferred** due to better error handling and the power of interceptors.

### 2. Managing the Data Lifecycle

When fetching data, components must manage **three states** to ensure a good User Experience (UX) and prevent crashes:

| State | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Loading** ‚è≥ | The request has been sent, and we are waiting for a response.| 
| **Success** ‚úÖ | The request returned data successfully.| 
| **Error** ‚ùå | The request failed (network error, 4xx, 5xx). | 

This is often implemented using a **custom hook** (`useFetch`, for instance) or a **state machine pattern** like `useReducer`.

```tsx
// Data Fetching State Example
const [data, setData] = useState(null);
const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(false);
const [error, setError] = useState(null);

useEffect(() => {
    setIsLoading(true);
    // Use try...catch for robust async error handling
    try {
        const response = await axios.get('/api/data');
        setData(response.data);
    } catch (e) {
        setError(e.message);
    } finally {
        setIsLoading(false);
    }
}, []);

```

### 3. Splash Screens (Perceived Performance)

The **Splash Screen** is the first screen a user sees when launching a mobile app. In React Native, this is **not a JavaScript component**; it is a **Native UI View** configured in **Xcode (iOS)** and **Android Studio (Android)**.

* **Purpose:** To display a branded image (logo) while the native platform is loading the **JavaScript bundle** and initializing the React Native runtime.
* **Perceived Performance:** It makes the application **feel faster** by replacing the blank white/black screen with a professional image. 
* **Hiding the Splash:** Once the JavaScript bundle loads and your root React component is ready to render, you must **imperatively hide** the native Splash Screen using a library (e.g., `react-native-splash-screen`) to transition seamlessly to your app's main view.
